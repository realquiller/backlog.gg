📁 This folder handles backend data flow and runtime storage.

- `*.template.json`: serve as reference structures for objects generated by the backend (e.g. `game`, `note`, `game_summary`)
- `games.json` a `notes.json`: runtime cache used to improve performance and avoid redundant API calls or recomputation. These files are ignored via `.gitignore`.

🔒 This folder does **not** contain any permanent or production-ready data.
